For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

I just finished the completion part of this assignment, i might go back to finish challenge questions if i have time. i think i am done quite successful so far, because i did check many times and fixed many bugs.

* When you load in the same taxonomy from the file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

i think this Depending on the method it writes because for the saving method it just saving the numbers（values） but not the locations.and each time it draws it just draw randomly.

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one of the nodes in that subtree.

it will conflict if we use add child form node method,Java will complains ：（ and you can’t add back to root tree.
but i think it can do it other way, remove the destinationNode stores in one place then remove targetNode stores in anther place, then add target subtree to  destinationNode， destinationNode add to last targetNode‘s parents。
