For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

i up the the completion part and stuck on the iterator part, i have no idea what it is and how this work. i got no successful in the assignment, i just keep doing worst and worst.


* Do you think that having both classes "Images" and "ImageNode" is overkill? 
  What pros and cons can you think of in comparison to just using ImageNode?
yes could be.

* Did you notice the different complexity of adding an image
  before vs after the cursor? 
  What are the complexities and what is the cause of this complexity difference?
that is the question i stuck on 

* Can you think of an extension to "ImageNode" that would avoid the 
  above mentioned complexity difference? 
i have no idea is this the challenge thinking？

* Cursors are a good way of obtaining quick access to a certain point in a list. 
  Can you think of a potential problem if a client does not use Images.setCursor correctly?
 if a client does not use Images.setCursor correctly？potential problem？because the cursor method is not work properly。
