I justï¼Œ finish the completion part of this assignment, and i am feeling i done quite successful so far.


What part(s) of the assignment did you find most interesting?

the core part, because i learned some new stuff about the 
array queue.

What part(s) of the assignment did you find most difficult?

the challenge part because i still not sure how to did it.



If you completed the completion part:

Show the results you obtained when using the priorty queue and compare them
to the results you obtained with the ordinary queue.
