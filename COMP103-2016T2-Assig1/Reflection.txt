For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (i.e. anything in the lectures to date, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

For what we are covered so far,in this assignment, i found out some particularly interesting problem  in the sprial question,  I never think about we can draw the image like this before i done the assignment， and i did learn a new away for doing 2D Graphics .and during the assignment  game 2048, i did  find out lots of bugs that when i did used a lot of for looper. The most common bugs i find out is （array  Index out of bounds），it makes me modify the bounds of the for loopers again and again. To exploring further（reduce bugs）, i think the best way to doing this is Write a rough draft before using for loops，and to calculate the bounds that is very important.
（In the assignment game2048 i did change the arrow keys to WASD for move up down left top, because the arrow keys didn’t work on my computer.）



lastly， i wanna said： “Thank you！ for all the Tutors.” you guys did help us a lot in Assignments and Tutorials.
